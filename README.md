# CometKMS - Remote Signer for CometBFT

**⚠️ Important:** DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE IN PRODUCTION!

This is a remote signer for CometBFT, which is used to sign blocks and transactions in a CometBFT network.
It is designed to be used in a development environment only, and is not suitable for production use.

## Installation

To install CometKMS, you need to have Go installed on your system. You can download Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

Once you have Go installed, you can install CometKMS by running the following command:

```bash
make build
```

This will build the `cometkms` binary in the GITREPO directory.

```bash
make install
```

This will install the `cometkms` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Usage

To use CometKMS, you need to run the binary with the following command:

```bash
./cometkms -addr <address> -statefile <state_file_path -privkey <private_key_path>
```

The -privkey flag uses a `priv_validator_key.json` typically generated by CometBFT networks.
